# M4G React Application

  This is an application I designed to showcase my knowledge of using REACT for HTML/Javascript coding. This app is a collection of reviews and news articles that users create for their favorite entertainment media, such as video games, TV Shows, or movies. They're able to set what type of article it is, news or review, set the review score, title, and write content for the page. If the users wish to, they're able to edit or delete content that they create, and only the content they created. I made two different pages. One page displays the content that every user created, and the other being the content only the user themselves created. The former page lets you do the editing and deleting.
  
  After working the weekly assignments for the movie review app. I got the idea to create a general news/review app like a Rotten Tomatoes or an IGN. I've general been interested in wanting to write reviews and news as a small hobby. So, figured to go ahead and make an app for just that.
